  <p>Majority of candidates re-use the same cover letter for every job application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is how you can easily stand out from the crowd by including the right information in your cover letter.</p>

<h2 id="demonstrate-you-have-skills-and-experience-for-the-job">Demonstrate you have skills and experience for the job</h2>

<p>Take 3 most important skills and experiences from the job description and write 2-3 lines for each one. Include examples of how you have used these skills in the past. Make sure to use the same <em>language</em> as the job description.
Ensure that you are not just repeating your resume.</p>

<h2 id="demonstrate-you-will-fit-in-with-the-team">Demonstrate you will fit in with the team</h2>

<p>A good job description will include information about how the team works together. You should include a sentence about how you have worked in a similar team in the past. This shows the hiring manager that you will fit in with the team.
If you have not worked in a similar team before, you can include a sentence about how you are looking forward to working in a similar team and why.</p>

<h2 id="show-you-have-researched-the-company">Show you have researched the company</h2>

<p>Most companies will have a vision and mission statement. Many will also have a set of values. You should include pick a value that is most important to you and demonstrate how in your past you have lived up to that value. This shows the hiring manager that you have done your research and are genuinely interested in the company.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should include these 5 points; 3 for skills, 1 for team-fit, 1 for company-fit; to have an effective cover letter that will make sure your resume stands out.</p>

Should you use AI to write your resume? Letâ€™s find out.</p>

<p>AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and other are extremely useful to write your resume. They can help you write a resume that is tailored to the job you are applying for. They can also help you write a resume that is free from errors and typos.</p>

<p>However, you should be judicious in using AI to write your resume.</p>

<p>Your experience, work history and achievements are unique to you. AI tools can help you write a resume, but they cannot replace your unique voice and perspective.</p>

<p>Here are some tips to use AI to write your resume:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write down as much as you can about your work summary, experience, and achievements in your own voice.</li>
  <li>Use AI tools to refine your resume, correct errors, and make it more readable.</li>
  <li>Make sure generated output AI does not sound robotic. It should sound like you.</li>
  <li>When providing context to AI, ensure you highlight why a certain achievement is important and how it impacted the business.</li>
</ol>

<p>A resume contains your work history and skills. It is usually same for all the jobs you apply for.</p>

<p>Whereas a cover letter is written specifically for the job you are applying for.</p>

<p>An effective cover letter is used to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Demonstrate that you have read through the job des##cription and understood requirements.</li>
  <li>Show that you have demonstrated skills and experience for this specific job.</li>

  <p>Most resumes have a lot of visual distraction making it harder to read and understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Common mistakes to avoid when formatting your resume:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Using a lot of colors</strong>: At most use three colors, white for background, very dark gray for text, and a color to highlight few very key points.</li>
  <li><strong>Using a lot of fonts</strong>: Use a single font for the entire resume, and use different font weights to differentiate between headings and body text.</li>
  <li><strong>Unreadable font</strong>: Use a font that is readable, make sure line height is good, and font size is not too small.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid multiple columns</strong>: Use a single column layout, it is easier to read and understand.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid using tables</strong>: Tables force you to have headings, so part of the information is elsewhere, making it harder to read. For example is it year of graduation or year of enrolment?</li>
  <li><strong>Separate sections</strong>: Make sure each section is clearly separated from the other sections, use higher margins or dividers.</li>

  <p>Applicant tracking system, or ATS, is a process software used by recruitments to improve efficiency of recruitment process.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-is-an-applicant-tracking-system">What is an applicant tracking system?</h2>

<p>It is a <strong>process management</strong> software used by recruitment teams to improve their efficiency.</p>

<p>It commonly provides features such as:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Job posting</strong>: Post job openings to various job boards and social media platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Resume parsing</strong>: Automatically parse resumes and extract relevant information.</li>
  <li><strong>Candidate tracking</strong>: Track candidates through the recruitment process.</li>
  <li><strong>Interview scheduling</strong>: Schedule interviews with candidates.</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting</strong>: Generate reports on recruitment process.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: Collect feedback from interviewers and candidates.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="myths-about-applicant-tracking-systems">Myths about applicant tracking systems</h2>

<p>Biggest myth candidates have is, ATS uses some keyword matching and resumes that do not contain these keywords are automatically rejected.</p>

<p>This is not true. ATS is a tool to help recruiters manage their recruitment process, not to reject candidates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have read through job description and are sure you qualify for it at even 50% level, apply for it. ATS will not reject you just because you did not use the right keywords.</p>
